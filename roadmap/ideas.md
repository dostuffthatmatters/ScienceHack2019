### Ideas
- monetize uploading public/private datasets
- support different forms of visualization
  - different color scales: for **continuous** data the default should probably be some viridis color scale, but other options (bright to dark, dark to bright etc.) could be available; for **discrete** data there has to be the option to select that the data is discrete and the color scale fitted accordingly
  - non-3D plotting forms like heatmap or simply plotting every data point in corresponding color (3D plots have the caveat that big bars tend to _hide_ smaller ones, thus skewing the visualization)
- ability for users to comment on maps
- ability for users to easily share public/private maps via a link or QR code
