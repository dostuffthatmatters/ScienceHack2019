### Business Plan

- who is the customer?
  - reporters
  - data analysts
  - researchers
- what is the problem we solve?
  - spending a lot of time on creating (interactive) visualisations of geospatial datasets
  - spending a lot of time on getting the infrastructure right to make them accesssable online
  - generally needing to know how to program to create geospatial visualisations
- how do customers get to know us?
  - seeing the tag "visualized using ..." on other visualisations
  - talk directly to potential customers and letting them try out the service free of charge
    - this could also bring in valuable feedback
  - how do our potential customers normally get to know about new services like ours?
- how to we monetize our solution?
  - the upload of either public or private datasets costs money
  - charge for how much value it brings, not for how much it costs
- how are we different than our competition?
  - (known) competitors
    - Datawrapper: https://www.datawrapper.de/
    - Flourish: https://flourish.studio/
    - are there others?
